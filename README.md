# UI-UX-Experiment1
## AIM
To develop a clear understanding of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design principles through practical analysis, real-world comparisons, and hands-on experimentation with professional UI/UX design tools.

## ALGORITHM
### Step 1: Define UI and UX
- Research and document definitions of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).
- Identify and list the core elements of each, including their goals and areas of focus.

### Step 2: Study Real-World Examples
- Select 2â€“3 popular websites or applications (e.g., Instagram, Airbnb, Amazon).
- Examine their **UI** elements such as color scheme, layout, icons, and typography.
- Examine their **UX** aspects like navigation flow, responsiveness, and user satisfaction.

### Step 3: Compare and Document Observations
- Create a comparison table to highlight strong/weak areas of UI and UX in the selected examples.
- Use screenshots to visually support the comparisons.
- Identify examples where a good UI failed due to poor UX or vice versa.

### Step 4: Understand the UI/UX Relationship
- Choose a user flow from a selected app or site (e.g., booking a hotel, ordering food).
- Map out the journey using a flowchart or wireframe.
- Annotate how specific UI elements impact UX (e.g., button placement improving task completion time).

### Step 5: Explore Design Tools
- Select at least two industry-standard UI/UX tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch).
- Create basic wireframes and interactive prototypes.
- Experiment with features like components, libraries, auto-layout, and real-time collaboration.

### Step 6: Reflect and Record Outcomes
- Compile screenshots of tools, wireframes, and prototypes.
- Summarize what was learned in terms of UI vs UX, tool usability, and best practices.
- Optionally, include improvement suggestions based on your case study findings.

## RESULT
Through these hands-on experiments, I developed a solid understanding of both UI and UX design principles. By analyzing real-world applications, I learned how good visual design (UI) must be paired with smooth user flows (UX) to create effective digital experiences. Using tools like Figma and Adobe XD, I created wireframes and prototypes, which helped me visualize how design decisions impact usability. These activities improved my design thinking, tool proficiency, and ability to evaluate and build better user-centered interfaces.
